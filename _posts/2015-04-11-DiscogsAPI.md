An Objective-C interface for [Discogs API v2.0](http://www.discogs.com/developers/) (a RESTful API to [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com/) data).

The library handles the authentication process as well as retreiving data like releases, masters, artists and labels. By using Discogs API, your application can also manage User Collections and Wantlists.
